evdev-rce for Debian

A program that solves the problem of right clicks on Linux devices with a touchscreen. It implements the
 long-press-to-right-click gesture on Linux touchscreen devices while having no specific requirements on the desktop
 environment, display server or the distribution, which greatly improves the touch experience for users of Linux
 distributions. It directly reads from evdev touchscreen input devices, parses the events, and triggers a right click
 with uinput when it detects a long press from a touchscreen. Since evdev is lower-level than libinput or any other
 user-space input driver, this program can work regardless of your choice of Xorg or Wayland.
